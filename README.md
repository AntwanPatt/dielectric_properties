# Dielectric properties

A python class to compute the dielectric properties of a system from molecular dynamics simulations data.

Quantities of interest are:
* static dielectric constant
* auto-correlation function of total dipole moment
* frequency-dependent dielectric function

TO DO:
```
* Class/function to compute quantities of interests from given M distribution
* Class/function to get M distri either from outfile of LAMMPS
* Class/function to calculate M from trajectory
* Class/function to output/plot results
```
